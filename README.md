# MineSweeper
A version of MineSweeper! This is one of the first games I ever developed.

During the middle of my senior year of high school, I got really obsessed with MineSweeper.
After making Tic-Tac-Toe for my AP Computer Science class, I decided to take what I learned about grid layouts, game flow, and buttons, to create my own version of MineSweeper!

In future, I plan on cleaning up the UI and possibly adding in more game modes!
