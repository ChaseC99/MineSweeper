# MineSweeper

### Created by <html><a href="https://github.com/ChaseC99/MineSweeper#contact-info">Chase Carnaroli</a></html>
This is my version of the popular game, *MineSweeper*!  
It is one of the first games I ever developed.

#### Background
During my senior year of high school, I got really obsessed with *MineSweeper*.
After making the game *Tic-Tac-Toe* for my AP Computer Science class, I decided to take what I learned about grid layouts, game flow, and buttons, to create my own version of *MineSweeper*!
